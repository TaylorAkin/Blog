                                The first week was everything that I expected to be.The lead team did a great
                                job informing me and others what to expct and it helped alot that i've had some
                                experience with the
                                programs we're using. I'm not struggling with too much right now, more so just becoming
                                more familiar with the things i'm
                                being refreshed on. Becoming more effecient I guess you could say.

                                The thing I'm most excited about is allowing my skills to match my imagination. Not
                                letting there be
                                barriers to limit creativity.

                                Psuedo coding is great because it allows me to speak in my own terms to describe
                                what the code needs to do. I can't wait to get better at it.
                                I know that I need to get better at how I word Pseudo code. So I think that's what
                                I'm struggling most with right now.
                                I'm most excited about speeding up my skills, speeding up results and making
                                cool projects.

                                I enjoy the moment of figuring out answers to taking creative thought to finished
                                product, while using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML being the structure of the
                                building if
                                you will, CSS the paitings and aesthetics,and JavaScript giving functionality and
                                making things
                                work.

                                I enjoy making the layout out the most right now, so you could say front end
                                development. Breaking
                                through and figuring out cool design methods and effects are things I enjoy. That's
                                what most of my
                                experiecne has been in thus far with web development.
                                I know user experience is what matters most and of course that is going to be best the
                                site actually
                                works, more back end work. Javascript is what I need to work on the most, making sure I
                                understand
                                syntak and taking psuedo code and thought to working code.

                                Refreshing my prior knowledge and learning more about HTML, CSS, and JS was
                                great and I learned alot. I used to really struggle with JS but with the practice and
                                instruction
                                thorugh the program I am way more confident with it.

                                The thing most new to me and most helpful is Psuedo code.It definitely helps me thin
                                through the
                                processes and function that have to happen to acheive the goal and purpose of the
                                programming.
                                I wouldn't say anything has hindered my progress but I will be able to learn much
                                faster with starting
                                full time training and being done with my former job. Asking questions and psuedo code
                                are the two
                                things I'm going to make sure to get better at.

                                Two things I learned this past week were C.R.A.P principles and the use of white space.

                                attention on where it needs ot be. Using repition to tie the website together.

                             JavaScript, once you begin to know the language and remember certain built in objects and uses it's 
                             super great to use. JS is great for building your HTML and I'm not at that point. I'm also getting more 
                             familiar with using Object Instances and building contstructor functions to help program with dry code.
                             I'm interested in getting more comfortable with those as well as learning more about classes.
